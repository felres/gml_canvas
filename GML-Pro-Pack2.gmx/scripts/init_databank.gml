 "The Colonial Council serves the UFSE as the representative#"
+"voice of the colonies that make up the alliance.##"
+"  Two chairs are designated to each colonial world, which#"
+"has appointed a Chancellor and Vice Chancellor by direct#"
+"democratic vote.  Equal representation is given to all#"
+"colonies, though each is given a priority certificate at#"
+"the beginning of each monthly meeting that sets the order#"
+"of crisis presentations in the Colonial Council Chambers.#"
+"This urgency rating is determined by political and#"
+"situational assessments made by an independent body of the#"
+"council that has a rotating roster made up of military#"
+"advisory committees headed up by V.C. who serve on the#"
+"council.  Every Vice Chancellor must serve.##"
+"  The actual titles given to the two positions that #"
+"fulfill council requirement are chosen by the various local#"
+"government philosophies on each colony.  The Allindorna#"
+"colonies, for example, choose to elect by the titles of#"
+"Intercessor and Vice Intercessor but the roles are#"
+"identical regardless of the titles chosen.##"
+"  The Colonial Council meets at Starbase Central, the hub#"
+"of UFSE activity, on decks 3 and 7 depending on council#"
+"vote taken near the conclusion of each meeting.##"
+"  The meeting place is kept in the confidence of council#"
+"members.  Deck 3 is a traditional Earth-like senate chamber,#"
+"while the Deck 7 facilities are a holo-garden that can take#"
